This is an **Android Helper Library**.

It consists in a collection of static methods that perform common functionalities.

## Get started
Just add dependency in your `build.gradle` module (`G` is available in jcenter):
```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.gabrielmorenoibarra.g:g:0.0.1'
}
```

## Use
Simply call any method directly over G class:

```java
G.metodName();
```
